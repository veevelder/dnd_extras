Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of @JournalEntry[Exhaustion], and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.</p>\n<p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of @JournalEntry[Exhaustion].</p>\n<p>On a successful save, the character's @JournalEntry[Exhaustion] level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of @JournalEntry[Exhaustion] below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.</p>","_id":"grWma3kOqJR0BTuK"}
